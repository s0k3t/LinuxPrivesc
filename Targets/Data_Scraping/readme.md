### Datas
---------

> Any information who could lead to an exploitation by social engineering will be researched, names, agendas, calendar or whatever but above all, full credentials, backup and other ssh keys badly stored are the first sought datas for a direct attack.
Often, a threat actor will first target a system administrator since their credentials frequently have privileges to directly access sensitive data and systems. With a sysadminâ€™s credentials and access, a cybercriminal can move anywhere, while arousing little or no suspicion. If an administrator is out of reach, the intruder will target low-privileged users to exploit their weaknesses.

There are systematically some files that will be inspected amongst applications and services to find any datas allowing an access to the system, this will determine the means of attack.

#### Some examples


- The Operating System

`cat /etc/*-release`

- The kernel version

`cat /proc/version`

- The environment

`cat /etc/profile`

- Printers and other devices

`lpstat -a`
`lsblk`

- Running services

`ps aux`

- Running services by root

`ps aux | grep root`

- Installed applications

`dpkg -l`

- '.conf' files

`cat /etc/apache2/apache2.conf`

- Scheduled jobs

`crontab -l`

- Networks

```
/sbin/ifconfig -a
cat /etc/networks
lsof -i
arp -e

```

- Users informations

```
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/shadow
cat /etc/group
cat /etc/sudoers
sudo -l
cat .bashrc
cat /etc/profile
```

- Accessible files

`ls -alhR /home`

- History

```
cat .bash_history
cat .nano_history
cat .*_history
history

```

- Private keys

```
cat .ssh/*
cat /etc/ssh/*
cat .gnupg/*

```

- File Systems
	- writeable files in /etc

	`find /etc/ -readable -type f 2>/dev/null`
	
	- /var
	
	`ls -alh /var/log`

	- mounted

	`df -h`

	- unmounted

	`cat /etc/fstab`

- File permissions, sticky bits, suid and guid

```
find / -uid 0 -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

```
- Languages installed

```
find / -name python*
find / -name gcc*

```

- Uploading ways

`find / -name wget # or ftp, netcat, ...`




You can check all these commands manually but you can use automatized tools such as [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS).
